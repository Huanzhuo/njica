## Description

The implementation of Newton's Iteration is based on FastICA in **[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)**. 
The network emulation is based on the **[comnetsemu](https://git.comnets.net/public-repo/comnetsemu)**.

## Requirements

Please install `vagrant` and `Virtualbox` on the host OS to build the emulator.
